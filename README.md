[Link to my app walkthrough](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16gh2W1uW5lGwQKuVTv8UWUXw2PEhXM9S/view)

# Description
This app was a challenge for me in the beginning because we had just learned a new technology in Node, but after a few meetings with TA's I was able to really grasp the concept of inquirer and node and how they mix so seemlessly. In the end I really enjoyed working on this project and I thought it was really cool that there are many different uses for Node.
